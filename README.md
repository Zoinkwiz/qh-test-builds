# Quest Helper Test Builds

This repo contains JAR files which can be used to run Quest Helper versions without any knowledge of IntelliJ.

To run a JAR file, you will need to run the following in the terminal whilst in this folder:

```
java -jar -ea FILE_NAME

For this to work, you will need to make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your machine.
